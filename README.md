# Replace Object
Adds a button to replace one object with another.
## Tutorial
The mod is pretty simple, the first object you select will be treated as the object you want to replace, the second as what you want to replace it with (these objects will be deleted). If you only have *2* objects selected, *all* instances of that object will be replaced. If you have *3 or more* objects selected, only the instances of that object *in your selection* will be replaced.
